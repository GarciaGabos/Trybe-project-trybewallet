## About
&nbsp;&nbsp; This is a project developed during my studies at Trybe. In this project, I developed an expenses tracker application. The user can save all expenses in a list, selecting the currency used for the purchase. All the exchange values are automatically calculated in real-time based on the [awesomeapi currency exchange API](https://docs.awesomeapi.com.br/api-de-moedas) and converted to Real (the Brazillian currency is used as the default).

## Technologies:
All technologies applied by me on this project:
- React (with Redux and React Router)
- Javascript;
- CSS;
- HTML;

## How to run the project:
- Git clone the repository;
- Navigate to the folder and install the dependencies with `npm install`;
- Done! Now you can start the application with `npm start`!
